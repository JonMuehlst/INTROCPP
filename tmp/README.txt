This is a simple module of linear functions and binom.

It is tested with Google test framework.

To install it:
1. Run 'make installonce' in the shell to install Google test framework, 
makedepend, and valgrind. This should be done only once.
2. Run 'make' in the shell to install the module with its testing and 
then run the tests.
3. If you change the name of files / includes you'll possibly need to 
update the Makefile and then run 'make depend' and only then run 'make'. 
If you change just the code in one of the files you'll only need to run 'make'.
